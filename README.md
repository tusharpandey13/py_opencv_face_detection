# py_opencv_face_track
A simple python script that uses opencv to track faces and eyes from the webcam's video feed.

This project is completely inspired by sendex's awesome tutorial on the same. I just added the alternate ROI for detecting the eyes as the code was detecting eyes even my mouth area :D
